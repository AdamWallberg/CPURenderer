# CPURenderer

This is a project I started because I wanted to see if I could manage to write 3D rasterization on the CPU. I have already achieved that goal, so there are no planned updates.

This project features the following:
- 3D rasterization
- Texturing
- Diffuse lighting
- Wonky multi-threading
- OBJ-parsing

PS. The program still uses the GPU to draw the final image onto the context, and for that I use GLFW. 
PSS. The code is somewhat of a clusterfuck since the development has been very experimental.
